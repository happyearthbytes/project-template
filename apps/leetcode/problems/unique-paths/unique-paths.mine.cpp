// There is a robot on an <code>m x n</code> grid. The robot is initially located at the <strong>top-left corner</strong> (i.e., <code>grid[0][0]</code>). The robot tries to move to the <strong>bottom-right corner</strong> (i.e., <code>grid[m - 1][n - 1]</code>). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.</p>
